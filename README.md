# Merry Christmas, My Love!

## Never Stop Singing

I have loved that you have been singing so much this year. I love hearing you sing and teaching our children to sing. If we can fit it into our schedule, I would love if you could continue enjoying and growing your voice.

Phoenix Music Lessons has a studio trial rate, so you can try it and see if you like it first. Depending on their schedules, which of their teachers would you like to try?

Erin, sounds like a good option. :-)
